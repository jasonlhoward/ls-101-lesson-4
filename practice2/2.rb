# Practice Problem 2

# Add up all of the ages from the Munster family hash:

ages = { "Herman" => 32, "Lily" => 30, "Grandpa" => 5843, "Eddie" => 10, "Marilyn" => 22, "Spot" => 237 }

total_age = 0
ages.each_value { |age| total_age += age }
p total_age

# Solution:
p ages.values.inject(:+) # => 6174
